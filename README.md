One of the most complex projects I have built using React is a Medical Appointment System. This project allows patients to register, log in, and book appointments with doctors based on their specialization. Patients can view doctor profiles, choose available time slots, and manage their bookings. Doctors have a dashboard where they can view their appointments and patient details. One of the standout features of this system is the real-time chat functionality that enables seamless communication between patients and doctors. I also integrated a payment module using Razorpay API in testing mode, which allows patients to complete payments securely after an appointment is marked as completed. Additionally, patients can download PDF medical reports for completed appointments. The duration of the project was approximately 3.5 months, and it was a self-learning project done independently. I used React Router for page navigation, Axios to handle HTTP requests, and Socket.IO for implementing the real-time chat feature. For the UI, I used Bootstrap and TailwindCSS to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. This project helped me strengthen my frontend development skills and gain experience in implementing real-world application features, including payment integration and live communication.
